# DataFuerte

A secure system for managing personal keys via a web server.

Under AGPL-3.0 license. Read LICENSE for more details.


Please note this software won't work without HTTPS, since it uses WebCrypto.

NEXT COMMIT
- Iterations field added to the elements table.
- PBKDF2 Iterations field actually works: the system iterates the amount in the configuration file and the amount of iterations is stored in the database for each element, so it can be dynamically changed. When decrypting, it will read the amount from the database and act accordingly.


‚öôÔ∏è TODO before this system can be used

Data organization should be stable so that nothing is lost with updates.


* "Iterations" configuration can be changed, and it will affect iterations from then on.
* Maybe include some visible iteration information on files.
* Add ConfigurationController to the tabs and/or allow it to be accessed after initial configuration
* Add texts to the types of encrypted elements, dynamically creating a textarea for them instead of a small text field.
* Final security assessment before the database and algorithms are set in stone.

‚öôÔ∏è TODO further

* Automatic installation script.
* Add files to the types of encrypted elements.
* Recommendations on Master Key creation (length, etc). Since it MUST be written everytime content is decrypted, now by design you can use different Master Keys. Probably this is a good idea.
* If several algorithms are considered, they might be chosen in the general configuration and/or for each content.
* File tags for the three kinds of content, to allow further organization.
* Hard reset mechanism.
* Search filters for passwords/texts/files.
* CSP headers and other security mechanisms.
* Unify all the screens into one and turn it into a virtual "filesystem". This may happen in the previous development phase.
* Fully APIfy the system to allow external clients for those who don't want to use the current frontend (?)



## üõ† How to install

### 1. Create the database

Login to MySQL:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```
Then run:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE datafuerte CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'user_datafuerte'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_pass';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON datafuerte.* TO 'user_datafuerte'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```


### 2. Copy .env.example to .env and configure it.

You will need at least:

```ini
APP_NAME=Datafuerte
APP_URL=http://datafuerte.local

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=datafuerte
DB_USERNAME=your_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_pass

# This will be the data for your admin user
SEED_USER_NAME=administrator
SEED_USER_EMAIL=admin@example.com
SEED_USER_PASSWORD=password

# More stuff you may want to configure according to your domain
APP_URL=http://datafuerte.local
SESSION_DOMAIN=datafuerte.local
```


### 3. Generate your APP KEY

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```


### 4. Install vendor dependencies

From the root directory:

```bash
composer install
```


### 5. Run migrations to prepare the database

From the root directory 

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 6. Run seeders to create first admin user

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```


### 7. Configure HTTPS domain

Browsers do not allow WebCrypto in HTTP without SSL.

You may want to create your own self-signed certificate by doing:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ssl && cd ~/ssl
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout datafuerte.local.key -out datafuerte.local.crt \
  -subj "/CN=datafuerte.local"
```

## 7.1. Apache

Then configuring your apache2/sites-available/datafuerte.local.conf file like:

```ini
<VirtualHost *:443>

    ServerName datafuerte.local

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /home/myuser/ssl/datafuerte.local.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /home/myuser/ssl/datafuerte.local.key

        DocumentRoot /var/www/datafuerte/public
        <Directory /var/www/datafuerte/public>
                Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride All
                Order allow,deny
                Allow from all
        </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/datafuerte_error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/datafuerte_access.log combined

</VirtualHost>
```

Don't forget to 

```ini
a2enmod ssl
```

## 7.2. Nginx

Otherwise, if you're using nginx, you may want to do

```ini
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name localhost;

    ssl_certificate     /home/myuser/ssl/datafuerte.local.crt
    ssl_certificate_key /home/myuser/ssl/datafuerte.local.key

    root /var/www/datafuerte/public;
    ...
}
```
