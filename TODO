* Password type should have password input type when adding
* Rename an element, specially folders
* Move an element to a folder, drag&drop.
* Search filters for passwords/texts/files, name search and tag search.
* Automatic installation script.
* Add files to the types of encrypted elements.
* Recommendations on Master Key creation (length, etc). Since it MUST be written everytime content is decrypted, now by design you can use different Master Keys. Probably this is a good idea.
* If several algorithms are considered, they might be chosen in the general configuration and/or for each content.
* File tags for the three kinds of content, to allow further organization.
* CSP headers and other security mechanisms.
* Fully APIfy the system to allow external clients for those who don't want to use the current frontend (?)
